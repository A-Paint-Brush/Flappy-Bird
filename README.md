## Compiling

If on Windows, the `win_compile.spec` Spec file is ready to use for Windows. Run `pyinstaller win_compile.spec`.

After that, run the `Flappy Bird.exe` executable in the folder `.\dist\Flappy Bird` to launch the game.

## How to Play

Game-play instructions are stored in the file `./Help/Instructions.txt`. The file can also be accessed in the game by clicking the "How to Play" button in the main menu.

## Credits

The images in the `./Images/Digits` and `./Images/Sprites` folder were found on the internet and probably were extracted from the original game. The images in `./Images/Icons` were all drawn by me except for the `window_icon.png` file, which is just a resized version of `./Images/Sprites/flap up.png`. The `./Unused Assets/SVGs` folder contains the SVG versions of the images in `./Images/Icons`, and they were all drawn in Inkscape by me. The files in the `./Unused Assets/Window Icons` folder are all resized/modified versions of `./Images/Sprites/flap up.png`. The audio file `./Sounds/Rickroll.wav` is a short audio clip of the song ["Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) on YouTube.
